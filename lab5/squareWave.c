//This code is distributed with no warranty expressed or implied.
//It does not contain any known bugs, but has not been tested.
//What it is intended to do is use the first two bytes of eeprom
//as an offset and direction for adjusting the internal oscillator
//The first byte is an unsigned byte that is the amount to adjust
//the OSCCAL register.  The next byte will be 0 or 1 depending on
//whether the adjustment should be positive (0) or negative (1).
//The value 0xff is intentionally avoided to distinguish unprogrammed
//eeprom locations.

//main first calls update_clock_speed to make the adjustments to
//the oscillator calibration and then calls init_pwm to set up
//a 100Hz 50% duty cycle square wave on OC1A (pin 15 on the 28 pin
//DIP package).

// it then calls init_gpio to initialize pins D0 and D1 (pins 2 and
// 3 on the 28 pin DIP package) these pins are controlled by the Pi
// these pins will communicate with the Pi to update the EEPROM to
// calibrate the internal oscillator, clock_cal is then called
// to look at the values of the pins and update the eeprom accordingly
