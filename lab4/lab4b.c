/*
	The purpose of this program is to something cool
	related to part A. Implements a simple game with
	the two buttons and the LED.
	- When the LED is at the rightmost position and
	  button A is pressed, the LED will start moving left.
	- When the LED is at the leftmost position and button
	  B is pressed, the LED will start moving right.
	- When a button is pressed when the LED is moving left
	  or right and is not at the edge, the player who did
	  not press the button gets a point.
	- When the game starts, the LED does not move until
	  button A is pressed, which will start the game.
	- Whenever a point is scored, the LED will be at
	  either the leftmost or rightmost edge (depending
	  on who scored). And will not move until the button
	  corresponding to that edge is pressed. (Call this serving)
	- If the LED is not moving, and the player who is not
	  the server presses the button, nothing happens.
	  If Ctrl+C (SIGINT) is sent to the program, the game
	  will end and the final score will be printed.
