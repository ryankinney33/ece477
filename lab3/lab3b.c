/*

The purpose of this program is to a number from a file, convert it to a thermometer code,
and light up the 8 LEDs accordingly. If the read value is 4.0, all LEDs should be on.
Every time the value halves, an LED should be shut off until they are all off.

Accepts a command line argument for the path to the file. If no argument is passed,
the program opens /proc/loadavg and reads the one minute average from it.
